Destruct function invoked automatically when complier relise
we don't need this object. complier invoked the Destruct automaticaly

like we creat two object n2 , n3 when the block of code is end the complier 
relise that objects passes out of scope we don't need these two object
then he invoked Destruct for this two objects.

Destructors are usually used to deallocate memory and do other cleanup

A destructor is called for a class object when that object
passes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
